An app that helps you find free ebikes (for Citibike members) in NYC. Started
off as a script and then became an app. Download [here.](https://apps.apple.com/app/ampednyc/id6461901377)

Based off this [tweet](https://twitter.com/adamnewyork/status/1661905991829536768?s=20). Uses
Citibike's internal API from their website to pull all available stations and
filter for empty and ebike only stations.
